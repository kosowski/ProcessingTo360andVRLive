Example for viewing in VR a Processing sketch rendering in 360.

The Processing sketch, located in folder "Spout360Export", renders a 360 camera into a texture and sends it in real time, via Spout, to a simple Project in Unity, located in folder "Spout360Player", so it can be viewed with a VR HMD.

Requirements:
You need to install Spout (http://spout.zeal.co/) Windows only, the same can be done in OSX via Syphon.
Processing 3
Unity 5.6 (although any other version should work)
